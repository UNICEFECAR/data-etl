    The API can be called with a API key, which you must generate by creating an account.

    URLs must be returning cs files (i.e. they should contain ''&format=csv-sdmx' contain in their URL)

    Parameters:
    api_call_url (str): URL request for the UNESCO API. You can build a data query and retrieve the URL for it with the query-builder: https://apiportal.uis.unesco.org/query-builder.
    subs_key (str): Your API key. You must create one. Visit https://apiportal.uis.unesco.org/getting-started for more info. The default value is the subscription key created by me (Michael Gramlich) in August 2020.
